 Friction modeling, identification, and compensation based on friction hysteresis and Dahl resonance
:::

::: note Abstract

This paper studies effects of friction on control systems and utilizes the observed frictional behavior to develop a parameter identification method for a friction model using frequency domain measurements. Friction exists in a wide range of drive systems due to physical contacts in bearing elements, transmissions, or motion guides. Friction in a control system can deteriorate performance by causing limit cycles or stick–slip, as well as larger tracking errors. Friction compensation can help to reduce following errors, but requires physical understanding and a reliable model of friction in both the gross- and the pre-sliding regimes. In this paper, we adopt the Generalized Maxwell-Slip (GMS) model and develop a frequency-domain method to identify the model parameters based on the frictional resonances, which occur due to the elastic behavior of friction at small amplitudes. With the experimentally identified parameters, the friction model is utilized to compensate the friction effects in a motion control system. The resulting system performance of a compensated and uncompensated control system is then compared in both the frequency and time domains to demonstrate the Dahl resonance identification method for a GMS model.
