 Lyapunov controller design for transverse vibration of a cable-linked transporter system
:::

::: note Abstract

Modeling and Lyapunov controller design for transverse vibration of a flexible cable transporter system with arbitrarily varying lengths are presented using Hamilton's principle and Lyapunov theory. The axial velocity of the system is assumed to be unknown in the model. This is different from existing literature where the axial velocity is assumed either to be constant or prescribed. The governing equations include two coupled non-linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and boundary conditions. The interactions between the cables and the slider, pulleys, and motors are included in the model. Numerical solution of the derived governing equations is obtained using Galerkin's method. Based on the Lyapunov theory, we propose two boundary controllers and one domain point-wise controller, which suppress the transverse vibration of the cables effectively while assuring the attainment of the slider goal. The proposed controllers dissipate the vibration energy and guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system in Lyapunov sense. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.
