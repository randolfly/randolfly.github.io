Usually, what is called sliding mode is employed in such synthesis. This sliding mode is characterized, in practice, by a high-frequency switching of the control. It turns out that the deviation of the system from its prescribed constraints (sliding accuracy) is proportional to the switching time delay. A new class of sliding modes and algorithms is presented and the concept of sliding mode order is introduced. These algorithms feature a bounded control continuously depending on time, with discontinuities only in the control derivative. It is also shown that the sliding accuracy is proportional to the square of the switching time delay.},

The innovative engineering concept and design pave a new road to realizing a huge single dish in the most effective way. Three outstanding features of the telescope are the unique karst depressions as the sites, the active main reflector which corrects spherical aberration on the ground to achieve full polarization and a wide band without involving a complex feed system, and the light focus cabin driven by cables and servomechanism plus a parallel robot as secondary adjustable system to carry the most precise parts of the receivers. Being the most sensitive radio telescope, FAST will enable astronomers to jumpstart many of the science goals, for example, the neutral hydrogen line surveying in distant galaxies out to very large redshifts, looking for the first shining star, detecting thousands of new pulsars, etc. Extremely interesting and exotic objects may yet await discovery by FAST. As a multi-science platform, the telescope will provide treasures to astronomers, as well as bring prosperity to other research, e.g. space weather study, deep space exploration and national security. The construction of FAST itself is expected to promote the development in high technology of relevant fields.},

Secondly, a feed support system which integrates optical, mechanical and electronic technologies will effectively reduce the cost of the support structure and control system.

    abstract = {This paper introduces control tests on a feed positioning system for a large radio telescope. The system is an integration of three subsystems, including a cable trolley subsystem, with a two-degrees-of-freedom orienting mechanism mounted on the trolley, which points a Gough-Stewart mechanism, the third subsystem. The first two subsystems provide a coarse control of the motion of the upper platform of the Gough-Stewart mechanism, while the Gough-Stewart mechanism gives a finer control of the feed-mounted lower platform by actively isolating the vibrations from the upper platform. Standard proportional-integral-derivative controllers with direct terminal feedback from the optical sensors are employed to control the system. Delay-induced dynamic instabilities encountered in the experiments are addressed. A simple error analysis on control with flexible cable is carried to validate the control of the cable-drive architecture. Tests are carried out on a field model of dimension 50 m/spl times/50 m/spl times/12 m. Typical experiments manifest remarkable positioning ability of the proposed system.},

    abstract  = {A macro-micro manipulator system is proposed to realize trajectory tracking control of a flexible manipulator system. This system has a flexible manipulator as a macro-manipulator and a rigid small manipulator on the tip as a micro-manipulator. While a flexible manipulator can move in wide range of space, it cannot realize precise tracking. The micro manipulator is used to compensate the tracking error due to the deformation of the macro-manipulator. The concepts of compensability and compensability measure for the macro-micro manipulator system are introduced. Considering the redundancy of the system, path planning is discussed in order to keep the compensability measure as large as possible during the whole work phase. A quasi-static trajectory tracking control system is proposed to realize the planned path. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.{$<>$}},
